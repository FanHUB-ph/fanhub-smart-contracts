# FanHUB smart contract for NFT Marketplace

## Resources / Tech Used

### Solidity (https://soliditylang.org/)
- Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms. It's used to create smart contracts that implement business logic and generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system.

### Hardhat (https://hardhat.org/)
- Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software. It consists of different components for editing, compiling, debugging and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, all of which work together to create a complete development environment.

### Goerli Testnet (https://goerli.net/)
- A cross-client proof-of-authority testing network for Ethereum.

### Pinata (https://www.pinata.cloud/)
- Pinata is an NFT media management service that allows users to host, manage and share files of any kind on the blockchain of their choice. As an IPFS pinning service, we focus on giving both technical and non-technical creators a fast, easy, and reliable way to share content without limits.
- For developers, Pinata is the easiest way to pin content to IPFS and build web3 applications without having to build and manage your own IPFS nodes. We do all the heavy lifting for you.
- For creators, Pinata makes it easy to serve content at scale without any technical experience. We offer anyone the ability to start creating without having to worry about the technical side of web3 or IPFS right away.


## Note
- We're still solidifying and testing the smart contract on our other UI/frontend before we integrate it to our mobile app and web app.
- As of now connecting to wallet, listing of NFT, getting the nft's in specific wallet is already working.
